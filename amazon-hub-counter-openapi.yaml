    Amazon's API for creating and updating Amazon Access Points. 
    
    This guide is intended for Amazon Store Feed partners who wish to integrate with the Access Points Onboarding API. This API enables partners to programmatically create, update and disable locations in Amazon systems.
    
    Throughout this guide, partner developers can learn how to:
    1. Create a developer account and security profile to access relevant API environments.
    2. Request and use an authentication token to access the API.
    3. Create, update and disable locations through the API.

    In the scope of this document we will refer to partner locations also as Access Point locations.

    # Developer Account Registration Process
    A security profile must be created to access the Access Points API: Register as an Amazon developer on https://developer.amazon.com/ to create a security profile.
    > **NOTE**: The email used for this account should be one dedicated for this purpose (e.g. amazon-pickup@corpdomain.com).
    
    > **NOTE**: Use a dedicated security profile for Access Points Partner Onboarding API. Do not use the same security profile for other use cases.

    ## Setting up a new Security Profile
    Access https://developer.amazon.com/ using an existing Amazon Account or a new Amazon Developer Account to create a security profile.
    
    Upon completion of the account registration process, access the Security Profile Management section from: 
    
    `Developer Console > Settings > Security Profiles` *(Figure 1)*.

    > ![Security Profile Management](assets/security_profiles_1.png)
    > *Figure 1 - Security Profile Management*

    Then create a new Security Profile by providing following information *(Figure 2)*:
    1. **Security Profile Name**: A name for this security profile. For example: _AccessPointsYourCompanyName-Production-Profile_.
    2. **Security Profile Description**: A brief description of this security profile.

    > ![Create a new Security Profile](assets/security_profiles_2.png)
    > *Figure 2 - Create a new Security Profile*

     Create security profile by clicking the ***Save*** button. This gives access to the Web Settings tab containing the following information *(Figure 3)*:

    1. **Client ID**:  A client identifier used for application to receive the OAuth token. This identifier must be input into Partner Central in order to enable access the API.
    2. **Client Secret**: Client secret or password (do not share secret with Amazon representatives or anyone else).

    The Client ID and Client Secret that have been created allows secure identification with Amazon Access Points Onboarding API. Both are needed of these in order to receive access tokens and authenticate with the API.

    > *Figure 3 - Security Profile Web Settings*

    > **NOTE**: Client ID is different to the Security Profile ID available from the General tab of the security profile. There is no need to share the Security Profile ID with Amazon.


    ### Submitting Client IDs to Amazon
    If the Partner is located in North America or Europe, they should submit their Client ID to Partner Central as soon as possible.

    If the Partner is located in Asia Pacific, Australia or Mexico, they should submit the Client ID to their Amazon representative as soon as possible.

    In case of 3P Partners in any marketplace, they should submit the Client ID to their Amazon representative as soon as possible.
    
    This will allow Amazon to enable the Client ID which will, in turn, allow the partner to access the Access Point Onboarding API and progress to the next step.

    Partners can send a maximum number of 15 API calls per day. If there is a specific business case for the Partner to perform more than 15 calls a day, please contact your Amazon representative to approve a temporary limit increase.

    # FAQ
    
    #### How do I submit regular store closures (e.g. a location close on Sundays)?
    You can skip entries for regular closure days in the standardHours array (e.g. skip SUNDAY if the location is closed on Sundays).

    #### How do I manage exceptional changes in opening hours? (e.g. different opening hours during Easter and Christmas holidays)
    We don't support yet exceptional changes in opening hours.
    
    #### How exceptional closures are reflected in the Amazon website?
    Exceptional closures submitted in the exceptionalClosures array are used to delay the Amazon customer promise, the customer will be able to see the location in the search results and on the address book. To temporarily remove a location from the website you can deactivate the location by setting the *isActive* parameter to 'false'.
    
    #### How do I create an exceptional closure starting from now and finishing some time in the future?
    You cannot use the current date for the exceptionalClosure startDateTime property as it will fail the validation, it has to be some time in the future. Consider if deactivating the location is not a best option for your use case.
    
    #### Are previously sent exceptional closures stored?
    No, you need to submit every future exceptional closure on each feed update. If you don't send the update again, the previously created ones will be delete as they are overwritten on every update.
    
    #### Are there any requirements for the format of the latitude and longitude properties?
    We support positive and negative digits and `.` (dot) as the decimal separator. The values must always be to 6 decimal places, ranging from -90 to 90 for latitude and -180 to 180 for longitude. The combination of 0,0 for both latitude and longitude will throw an error. 
    
    #### Why am I not able to get the LWA token while invoking api.amazon.com?
    Please validate following:

      1. Validate Header `Content-Type`. The value should be `application/json`.
      2. Validate clientId, clientSecret, grantType (should be `client_credentials`) and scope (should be `accesspoints::accesspoint:readwrite`).
      3. Validate URI (should be https://api.amazon.com/auth/o2/token) and HTTP VERB (should be `POST`).
    
    #### Why is the API endpoint submit Feed (/v1/feeds POST) returning 4XX code?
    Please validate following:

      1. Token is valid and issued within one hour of API invocation.
      2. Token passed in `Authorization` header while invoking Access Points API. Authorization header value should be formatted as `Bearer <Token granted from api.amazon.com>`. There must be a space in between `Bearer` and token.
      3. Validate the DNS name and overall URI
    
    #### Why is the API endpoint get Feed (/v1/feeds GET) returning 4XX code?
    Please validate following:

      1. Token is valid and issued within one hour of API invocation.
      2. Token passed in `Authorization` header while invoking Access Points API. Authorization header value should be formed as `Bearer <Token granted from api.amazon.com>`. There should be a space in between `Bearer` and token.
      3. Validate that the variable feedId and documentId are correct in URL.
      4. Validate the DNS name and overall URI.

    #### Which checks need to be done before start invoking Access Points API?
    Please validate following:

      1. Check that your email server allows mails from amazon.com. If not please whitelist the amazon.com domain.
      2. `Content-Type` should be `application/json` for all POST calls.
      3. `Content-Length` should not exceed 6MB.

    ####  I cannot set the closingTime to 00:00:00, how do I represent a location that is open 24hrs?
    Set the standardHours openingTime to 00:00:00 and the closingTime to 23:59:00, this will be shown as *Open 24hs* on Amazon website.

    #### How do I hide/remove a location from Amazon website?
    Send a feed updating that store and set the *isActive* flag to `false`.

    #### Can't I just send the JSON properties for the Access Point I want to update?
    No, the logic behind the update overwrites every property of the Access Point that matches the accessPointId on your request, if you omit properties they will be set to null/empty.

    #### How do I get a list of the Access Points I have submitted?
    This is not possible currently via the API. Upon request, we can generate a csv file with the list of your stores in the production environment.

    #### Can you send the entire list of locations?
    If the number of stores is less than 3000, you can send all of them together in one single feed. Or else, please divide the list in different feeds with no more than 3000 stores per feed.
   
    #### Should we send one store per feed or all stores can be sent in a single feed?
    As mentioned above, no more than 3000 stores should be sent in a single feed. For less than 3000 stores, only one feed should used to create/update stores.

    #### Do we need a developer email address only used for this specific purpose? 
    We strongly suggest to use an specific email for this to avoid access problems in the future with personal emails. 
   
    #### When should we use exceptional closures and when to deactivate a store?
    When the store needs to be closed for more than 3 days, the store should be deactivated. For less than 3 days, temporary closures should be used.
   
    #### Can stores be created with the same address but with a different store name?
    Yes, but they need to have different store name. It is taken into account for identifying the store.
    
    #### Can we select Null values?
    For the fields which aren’t marked required, those can be skipped from the JSON schema in the feed. Although, if they are being provided, they can’t be null or empty.
    
    #### Which timezone should we select for country that have 2 timezones?
    For this particular scenario, input hours provided in the feed should be local for opening hours although different timezone should be specified via “timezone” field in the feed.
   
    #### Which fields are mandatory? `Applicable only for feedType=3P`
    For a 3P feed type, the mandatory fields are “accessPointId", "accessPointName", "isActive", "timeZone", "address", "standardHours", "capabilities", "capacity".

            Please use the following format:
            Three capital letter prefix identifying the company followed by a hyphen and internal store ID (if exists).

            If internal IDs not already in use, please assign a four digit number to each of the stores for the format to follow.

            E.g. For Acme store 45: `ACM-0045`

            Using this format for store IDs will make quality reporting with Amazon much more efficient as it is easier to identify individual stores.

            For example: `Amazon Counter - Acme Manchester`. 
            
            There is a 50-character limit for this field - therefore 29 characters available following `Amazon Counter - ` to provide location business name and descriptor.

            > **NOTE**: If this is a third party pick-up point the `Amazon Counter - ` prefix does not apply.
        loginClaim:
          type: string
          example: 'store123@companydomain.com or +447999999123'
          description: |
            Unique email address or mobile phone accessible by store manager that will be associated with the store. Store manager will either create a new Amazon account or sign into Counter app using this loginClaim for the store. A loginClaim can only be mapped to one store at a time.

            Email loginClaim must only be provided in RFC 5322 format and phone loginClaim must be provided in international format, preferably E164; beginning with + and country code. E.g. email: store123@companydomain.com, phone: +447999999123. Please note that loginClaim is case insensitive and email loginClaims such as abc@xyz.com will be treated same as ABC@xyz.com. Similarly, phone numbers such as +447999999123 and +44(7999)-999123 will be treated as same.
       
            loginClaim is honoured only for approved clients. For unapproved clients, the field is ignored even if sent in the feed. Please contact your Amazon Representative to check if you are approved for using this field.

            loginClaim is not mandatory for existing stores that were onboarded without loginClaims, but is mandatory for any new stores of approved clients and stores which are already associated to some loginClaims in Amazon systems.

            Stores onboarded with loginClaim will receive location activation notification via either email or SMS depending upon the channel provided in communication details. Email takes precedence over SMS in case both are provided. In case no communication details are provided, notification will be sent to email or phone that was provided in the loginClaim field.

            loginClaim is an updatable field for a store record as long as the input loginClaim has not been used for a store activation on Counter app. In other words, if a loginClaim X is mapped to store Y which was previously activated, then the loginClaim X cannot be used for any other store.

            Once a partner maps a loginClaim to a store, no other client can use that same loginClaim to map to any of their stores. Thus, loginClaims are reserved within the Partner namespace. However, the same Partner is allowed to update the login claims for its planned stores as many times as required.

            It is recommended to send loginClaims for all the stores in a single feed. To understand why, let us consider the following scenario: 
            - Partner submits a feed to onboard store Y with loginClaim A and store Z with loginClaim B. 
            - loginClaim A is mapped to store Y, while login claim B is mapped to store Z. 
            - The Partner then sends a feed to update store Z with loginClaim A. Given both the stores are in the 'Planned' state and belong to same client, operation will succeed. 
            - Since a loginClaim can be mapped only to one store at a time, loginClaim A will finally be mapped to store Z, whilst loginClaim B will be removed from the system, leaving store Y abandoned. 
            To mitigate this risk, clients are advised to send loginClaims for all the stores in a single feed.
